# Final Notes

# Advanced AngularJS

## What are decorators?

Decorators are a design pattern that is used to separate modification or decoration of a class without modifying the original source code. In AngularJS, decorators are functions that allow a service, directive or filter to be modified prior to its usage.

[https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/decorators](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/decorators)

There are two ways to register decorators

```javascript
$provide.decorator
module.decorator```

Each provide access to a `$delegate`, which is the instantiated service/directive/filter, prior to being passed to the service that required it.
